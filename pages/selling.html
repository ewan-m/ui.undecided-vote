      And it really is that simple! We need to know your area code so we know
      which parties you could vote for. If you're in a marginal seat then you
      can earn even more.

      It's about time you made some money out of putting up with boring politics
      for so long now. Currently we have it setup so you can get paid into your
      Paypal.
